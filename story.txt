Once there was a puppy named Basket. He had brown fur. He liked water.
One day, Basket went outside and realized everything had disappeared. He was surrounded by empty white space that spanned as far as he could see. Basket thought it was odd that everything would visually dissappear into nothingness, but his nose could still pick up the scent remnants of what used to be.
